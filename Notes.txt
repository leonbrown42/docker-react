Run tests: 
    docker run -it b1c4540dff27cd2217716a82b27f1c72c126d829c955d934cc74f27ed42f0e1c npm run test

Run container & then tests
    docker-compose up
    docker ps
    docker exec -it [container id] npm run test

After making changes to docker-compose, build new containers
    docker-compose up --build
    This can't interact with tests however via "docker attach [container id]"
    But don't need to write out the command in terminal

ssh into container
    docker exec -it 2744d12a08b9 sh

    To see running processes in container
    /app # ps
    PID     USER    TIME    COMMAND
    01      root    0:00    npm run start
